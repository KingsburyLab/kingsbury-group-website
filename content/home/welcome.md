Welcome to the Kingsbury research group website. We seek to **accelerate development of electrochemical technologies for environmental protection.** We do so by by investigating how charged particles (**ions**) move through engineered separation materials like **membranes.**

**Membranes that filter specific types of ions** (ion exchange membranes) can be found in nearly every electrochemical technology imaginable, including processes for **water desalination, wastewater recycling, energy storage,** and **energyp production.**

The Kingsbury group is proudly housed in the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering](https://cee.princeton.edu/) and the [Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment](https://acee.princeton.edu/) at Princeton University.
