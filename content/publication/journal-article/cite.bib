It is now feasible to carry out high-throughput calculations using more accurate methods, such as meta-GGA DFT; however recomputing an entire database with a higher-fidelity method would not effectively leverage the enormous investment of computational resources embodied in existing (GGA) calculations. Instead, we propose here a general procedure by which higher-fidelity, low-coverage calculations (e.g., meta-GGA calculations for selected chemical systems) can be combined with lower-fidelity, high-coverage calculations (e.g., an existing database of GGA calculations) in a robust and scalable manner. We then use legacy PBE(+               U               ) GGA calculations and new r               2               SCAN meta-GGA calculations from the Materials Project database to demonstrate that our scheme improves solid and aqueous phase stability predictions, and discuss practical considerations for its implementation.},

  abstract = {Ion exchange membranes (IEMs) are versatile materials relevant to a variety of water and waste treatment, energy production, and industrial separation processes. The defining characteristic of IEMs is their ability to selectively allow positive or negative ions to permeate, which is referred to as the permselectivity. Measured values of permselectivity that equal unity (corresponding to a perfectly-selective membrane) or exceed unity (theoretically impossible) have been reported for cation exchange membranes (CEMs). Such non-physical results call into question our ability to correctly measure this crucial membrane property. Since weighing errors, temperature, and measurement uncertainty have been shown to not explain these anomalous permselectivity results, we hypothesized that a possible explanation are junction potentials that occur at the tips of reference electrodes. In this work, we tested this hypothesis by comparing permselectivity values obtained from bare Ag/AgCl wire electrodes (which have no junction) to values obtained from single-junction reference electrodes containing two different electrolytes. We show that permselectivity values obtained using reference electrodes with junctions were greater than unity for CEMs. By contrast, electrodes without junctions always produced permselectivities lower than unity. Electrodes with junctions also resulted in artificially low permselectivity values for AEMs compared to electrodes without junctions. Thus, we conclude that junctions in reference electrodes introduce two biases into results in the IEM literature: (i) permselectivity values larger than unity for CEMs, and (ii) lower permselectivity values for AEMs compared to those for CEMs. These biases can be avoided by using electrodes without a junction.}

  abstract = {Ion exchange membrane (IEM) performance in electrochemical processes such as fuel cells, redox flow batteries, or reverse electrodialysis (RED) is typically quantified through membrane selectivity and conductivity, which together determine the energy efficiency. However, water and co-ion transport (i.e., osmosis and salt diffusion / fuel crossover) also impact energy efficiency by allowing uncontrolled mixing of the electrolyte solutions to occur. For example, in RED with hypersaline water sources, uncontrolled mixing consumes 20-50\% of the available mixing energy. Thus, in addition to high selectivity and high conductivity, it is desirable for IEMs to have low permeability to water and salt in order to minimize energy losses. Unfortunately, there is very little quantitative water and salt permeability information available for commercial IEMs, making it difficult to select the best membrane for a particular application. Accordingly, we measured the water and salt transport properties of 20 commercial IEMs and analyzed the relationships between permeability, diffusion and partitioning according to the solution-diffusion model. We found that water and salt permeance vary over several orders of magnitude among commercial IEMs, making some membranes better-suited than others to electrochemical processes that involve high salt concentrations and/or concentration gradients. Water and salt diffusion coefficients were found to be the principal factors contributing to the differences in permeance among commercial IEMs. We also observed that water and salt permeability were highly correlated to one another for all IEMs studied, regardless of polymer type or reinforcement. This finding suggests that transport of mobile salt in IEMs is governed by the microstructure of the membrane, and provides clear evidence that mobile salt does not interact strongly with polymer chains in highly-swollen IEMs.}

  abstract = {© 2020 Elsevier B.V. Electrodialysis, reverse electrodialysis, and related electrochemical processes are increasingly important technologies for water purification and renewable energy generation and storage. The electrical efficiency of these processes is directly related to the permselectivity of the ion exchange membranes (IEMs) – defined as the extent to which the membrane permits the passage of counter-ions (ions of opposite charge to the membrane, e.g., cations for a cation exchange membrane) while blocking passage of co-ions. Permselectivity is not a material constant, but rather depends on the concentration and composition of the electrolyte solutions in contact with the IEM. Thus, even though permselectivity is routinely measured at standardized conditions (usually 0.5 M/0.1 M NaCl or KCl), the practical utility of such data is limited because we lack an accurate, quantitative way of using it to predict permselectivity under relevant process conditions. Moreover, the concentration dependence of IEM permselectivity has historically been studied primarily by evaluating the performance of (reverse) electrodialysis stacks rather than individual membranes, which has made it difficult to relate the concentration dependence of permselectivity to specific membrane characteristics. In this study, we measured the permselectivity of four commercial IEMs in six different concentration gradients employing 4 M and 0.5 M NaCl as the high salt concentration. We then constructed a predictive model of membrane permselectivity based on the extended Nernst-Planck equation and investigated how accounting for convection and electrostatic effects (via Manning's counter-ion condensation theory) affected model accuracy. We demonstrate that accurate, quantitative predictions of IEM permselectivity as a function of external salt concentrations are possible and require knowledge of only four easily measured membrane properties: water uptake, water permeability, charge, and thickness.},

Here we present the experimental and modeled performance of a rechargeable electrodialytic battery system developed for the purpose of energy storage. Experimental round-trip energy efficiency ranged from 21.2\% to 34.0\% when cycling the system between 33\% and 40-90\% state of charge. A mass transport model based on chemical thermodynamics is also proposed to describe the system’s performance. Results indicate that, upon model calibration, the model effectively predicts experimental values. Experimental and modeled results suggest that the membrane resistance and osmosis are the primary sources of ohmic and faradaic energy losses, respectively. The results demonstrate that a functioning battery can be constructed using typical reverse electrodialysis stack components. Future improvements in membrane technology and optimization of the system chemistry offer promising avenues to improve the power density, energy density, and round-trip energy efficiency of the process.},

To date, however, knowledge of RED is largely based on synthetic sodium chloride solutions that simulate natural waters. Accordingly, in this work we measured the RED performance of five real water pairs, including seawater, river water, desalination brine, saline wastewater from a pickling plant, and treated wastewater. We compared the performance of each real water pair with that of synthetic control waters to investigate the individual impacts of inorganic constituents (e.g., multivalent ions) and natural organic matter (NOM). Our results indicate that the presence of NOM has a larger impact on power density than ionic composition. Specifically, NOM reduced power densities by up to 43\%, while inorganic constituents reduced power densities by up to 8\% compared to control waters. Furthermore, UV-absorbing NOM present in the dilute compartment of the RED stack was strongly associated with reduced membrane permselectivity and energy efficiency. Taken together, our findings highlight the important role of organic matter in determining the RED performance of real waters.},

In closed-loop RED, which we recently demonstrated as a new means of energy storage, the transport of water by osmosis has a very significant negative impact on the faradaic efficiency of the system. In this work, we use neutral, non-permeating solutes as “osmotic ballasts” in a closed-loop concentration battery based on RED. We present experimental results comparing two proof-of-concept ballast molecules, and show that the ballasts reduce, eliminate, or reverse the net transport of water through the membranes when cycling the battery. By mitigating osmosis, faradaic and round-trip energy efficiency are more than doubled, from 18\% to 50\%, and 7\% to 15\%, respectively in this non-optimized system. However, the presence of the ballasts has a slightly negative impact on the open circuit voltage. Our results suggest that balancing osmotic pressure using non-charged solutes is a promising approach for significantly reducing faradaic energy losses in closed-loop RED systems.},

However, no well-established method exists to measure solute partition coefficients into polyamide active layers. Further, the few studies that measured partition coefficients for inorganic salts report values significantly higher than one (\textasciitilde 3-8), which is contrary to expectations from Donnan theory and the observed high rejection of salts. As such, we developed a bench-top method to determine solute partition coefficients into the polyamide active layers of RO membranes. The method uses a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to measure the change in the mass of the active layer caused by the uptake of the partitioned solutes. The method was evaluated using several inorganic salts (alkali metal salts of chloride) and a weak acid of common concern in water desalination (boric acid). All partition coefficients were found to be lower than 1, in general agreement with expectations from Donnan theory. Results reported in this study advance the fundamental understanding of contaminant transport through RO membranes, and can be used in future studies to decouple the contributions of contaminant partitioning and diffusion to contaminant permeation.}
