Our fundamental research on membranes is motivated by **electrically-driven** separation and energy processes such as electrodialysis and redox flow batteries. We perform lab-scale testing of electrochemical devices and use electrochemical techniques like impedance spectroscopy (EIS) to characterize membrane performance.
