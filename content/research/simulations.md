We employ **atomistic simulations** like density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamics (MD) to better understand experimentally-observed trends in ion selectivity. For example, simulations can generate rich information about the way water molecules arrange themselves around different ions, and how ion-specific differences in hydration relate to transport.
