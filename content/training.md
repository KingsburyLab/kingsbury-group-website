## python

Python is the language of modern data science. It is powerful, easy to use, and powers a
vast ecosystem of software, utlities, and training materials.

#### Basics

- [Python Tutorial Part 1](https://workshop.materialsproject.org/primer/01_basic_python/1%20-%20Python%20Primer/) from the Materials Project Workshop - expressions, variables, data types, and for loops
- [Python Tutorial Part 2](https://workshop.materialsproject.org/primer/02_python_part2/lessons/) from the Materials Project Workshop - dictionaries, functions, and classes
- [Video Tutorial - Python Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vga6eV3IAac&list=PLTjFYVNE7LTiuOK8Re7ltY0a3OHFcQhAE) from the Materials Project Workshop (taught by Prof. Kingsbury!)
- [Video Tutorial - Python Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bplWlAgyjg0&list=PLTjFYVNE7LTiuOK8Re7ltY0a3OHFcQhAE&index=3) from the Materials Project Workshop
- Installation - [setting up `pip` and `conda` environments](https://workshop.materialsproject.org/primer/04_Python_environments/1_pip_and_conda/)


#### Advanced Topics


These tutorials introduce more advanced concepts that are relevant for writing high quality code,
packaging and distributing software, etc.

- [args and kwargs](https://calmcode.io/args-kwargs/introduction.html) in function definitions
- Writing [comprehensions](https://calmcode.io/comprehensions/introduction.html) for more compact code
- Dealing with files using [pathlib](https://calmcode.io/pathlib/do-not-hardcode.html)
- Automatic unit conversions with [pint](https://calmcode.io/shorts/pint.py.html)
- Adding nice progress bars with [tqdm](https://calmcode.io/tqdm/making-a-progress-bar.html)
- Linting code with [flake8](https://calmcode.io/flake8/introduction.html)
- Automatically formatting code with [black](https://calmcode.io/black/introduction.html)

## Jupyter notebooks

Jupyter notebooks provide a way to interactively run and share python code. Thet are **the** recommended way to
practice, learn, experiment, and share your work.

## git and GitHub

`git` and GitHub provide version control and feedback tools for collaboratively developing and maintaining code.
The open-source codes used by our research group are all hosted on GitHub.

#### Basics

- [The Beginner's Guide to git and GitHub](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-beginners-guide-to-git-github/)
- [Getting Started with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/hello-world) - official documentation
- [GitHub skills](https://skills.github.com/) - bite-sized tutorials walking through how to use GitHub
- [Traveling the Multiverse with Git and GitHub](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-git-and-github-14213624/travel-the-multiverse-with-git-and-github) [LinkedIn Learning]
- [GitHub glossary](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-glossary) explaining different terminology

#### Advanced Topics

- [git cheatsheet](https://training.github.com/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet/)
- Setting up [pre-commit](https://calmcode.io/pre-commit/the-problem.html) to automatically check code quality
- [Mkdocs](https://calmcode.io/mkdocs/intro-to-mkdocs.html) system for building documentation
- [pyscaffold](https://pyscaffold.org/en/stable/) template for open-source python projects
- Software release procedures - [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) vs. [Git Flow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) (and [comparison](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/git-flow-vs-github-flow/))
